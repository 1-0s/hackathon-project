### Development
#### When working on a component ensure to make a branch, save all your work to that branch, to avoid conflicting the code base.

#### After Cloning/ Fetching the Codebase using either of the commands - 
 ```sh 
gh repo clone 1-0s/hackathon-project
 ```
#### or 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/1-0s/hackathon-project.git
```

#### Create a new branch using the command -
```sh
git branch example
```
#### Switch to the new branch using either of the commands -

 ```sh 
 git switch example
 ```
#### or 
```sh
git checkout example
```
#### Ensure to make detailed and precise commits to enable other developers working the project understand the workflow. If you fix something, start your commit with FIX, if you add something, start your commit message with FEAT

```sh
 git commit -a -m 'FIX: made a change'
```

#### Push to the origin

```sh
git push
```
